# GAWMerge
Genotyping Array-WGS Merge, GAWMerge, is a protocol to combine genotypes from arrays and whole genome sequencing (WGS) in GWAS. Thus, WGS data from diverse samples like (TOPMed) can be used as public control with existing array genotyped data in GWAS.

The CWL workflow for GAWMerge has been developed on BioData Catalyst Powered by Seven Bridges. It will be shared very soon.
